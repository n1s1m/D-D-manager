  "designPrinciples": {
    "darkModeFirst": "The entire interface is built on deep dark backgrounds. Default to dark; light mode is optional. Prioritize readability and visual impact in low-light.",
    "vibrantAccentsOnDark": "Use bright, saturated accent colors sparingly against the dark canvas. Accents draw attention to CTAs, active states, and key data.",
    "depthAndLayering": "Create hierarchy with subtle gradients, soft glows, and card elevation. Cards/panels sit slightly above the background; use borders or inner glow, not flat fills.",
    "modernAndSleek": "Clean lines, ample negative space, contemporary typography. Avoid clutter; let elements breathe.",
    "visualHierarchy": "Establish hierarchy through size, weight, and color: headings command attention (white, bold); body is readable (light gray); secondary content is muted.",
    "consistency": "Apply the same radius, spacing scale, and component patterns everywhere. Rounded corners throughout.",
    "engagement": "Use color and subtle motion (glows, gradients) to make the UI feel alive and premium without being noisy."
  },

  "color": {
    "philosophy": "Deep charcoal/blue-black canvas with a few high-saturation accent colors. Text is high-contrast for accessibility.",
    "backgrounds": {
      "primary": "Deep charcoal or blue-black. HSL approx: 224 40% 6% or 220 20% 8%. Near #0A0815 to #1A1E2C.",
      "secondary": "Slightly lighter for cards/panels. HSL approx: 224 30% 10% or 222 25% 12%. #1A1E2C, #272B3A.",
      "elevated": "For modals, dropdowns. One step lighter than secondary, optional subtle inner glow."
    },
    "accents": {
      "primary": "Vibrant purple/magenta for main CTAs and key highlights. HSL 270 80% 55% to 280 90% 60%. #8A2BE2, #A020F0.",
      "secondary": "Electric blue for links, selected states. HSL 210 100% 56%. #00C8FF, #3A82F6.",
      "success": "Bright green for positive values, success. #00FF00 range or #2ECC71.",
      "warning": "Orange/amber for warnings, progress. #FF7A00, #FACC15.",
      "destructive": "Red for errors, destructive actions. Softer in dark: HSL 0 70% 45%."
    },
    "text": {
      "primary": "Off-white or pure white for headings and important content. #FFFFFF, #F0F0F0.",
      "secondary": "Light gray for body. #CCCCCC, #AAAAAA, HSL 213 20% 85%.",
      "muted": "Medium gray for labels, placeholders. #808080, HSL 213 10% 55%."
    },

    "philosophy": "Modern, geometric sans-serif. Clean and legible; headings have presence; body is comfortable to read.",

      "heading": "Same as sans or a slightly more distinctive sans (e.g. Plus Jakarta Sans). Bold for H1/H2."

    "letterSpacing": "Slight negative on large headings (-0.025em to -0.03em). Normal for body.",
    "lineHeight": "Generous for body (1.5–1.65). Tighter for display headings if desired."

    "grid": "Flexible grid; two-column layouts for hero/content split. Collapse to single column on small screens.",
    "maxWidth": "Constrain main content width for readability (e.g. 1280px); allow full-bleed for hero or banners.",
    "borderRadius": "Rounded everywhere: 0.5rem–1rem for cards, 0.375rem–0.5rem for buttons and inputs. Softer than sharp."
  },

  "components": {

  "effects": {
    "glow": "Use sparingly on primary CTAs or key metrics. Box-shadow with accent color, blurred.",
    "gradients": "Purple-to-blue or purple-to-magenta for hero areas, buttons, or decorative backgrounds. Keep subtle on dark.",
    "shadows": "Soft, dark shadows for elevation (e.g. 0 4px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)). Avoid harsh black."
  },

  "motion": {
    "philosophy": "Subtle and purposeful. Prefer short transitions (150–300ms) for hover/focus.",
    "hover": "Slight brightness or scale; optional glow increase on buttons."

  "accessibility": {
    "contrast": "Ensure text on dark meets WCAG AA. White/light gray on dark blue-black typically passes.",
